Aziz: Hello Malick, is there anything you want me to do for you?
Malick: No, Aziz. I was just wondering if you work tomorrow afternoon?
Aziz: Yes, I do. What was it about?
Malick: I needed a ride to the Global Market, but it's fine, I will ask Mariam.
Aziz: Okay, sorry I couldn't help.
Malick: Not a problem at all.
